## 0 Introduction to OOP
### 0.1 Difference between Procedure-Oriented and Object-Oriented
| Procedure-Oriented                                                  | Differences  | Object-Oriented                                           |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Divides into methods                                                |   Division   | Divides into classes and objects                          |
| Appropriate for simple program                                      | Application  | Appropriate for complex program                           |
| Algorithm                                                           | Dealing with | Data                                                      |
| Less secure                                                         |   Security   | More secure                                               |
| Top-down                                                            |   Approach   | Bottom-up                                                 |
| Low                                                                 | Productivity | High                                                      |
| Does not allow overloading                                          | Overloading  | Allows operator overloading and function overloading      |
| Data is not hidden and can be passed globally from method to method | Data Hiding  | Data is hidden and cannot be accessed by external methods |
| Difficult to add new data and method                                |  Expansion   | Easy to add new data and method.                          |
